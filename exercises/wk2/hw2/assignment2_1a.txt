Algorithm/PsuedoCode:
1. Start by creating an infinite loop, as you don't know how many employees.
2. Then ask for the paycode either W, H, C, P. If Q is entered exit the program
3. Using a swith prompt the user for to enter the number of employees of each paycode (minimum of 2).
4. If W then they have a fixed weekly salary. Must ask for the weekly salary. If international students then you can't work more than 20 hours.
5. If H then have a wage for the first 10 hours. Over 10 hours must times their wage by 1.5. Must ask for the hours worked and wage.
6. If C then they receive 250 + 7.1 * hours worked per person. Must ask for hours worked.
7. If P then they receive fixed money * each item they produce. Ask for fixed amount and the items produced.
8. Once finished with the program display the weekly salary paid to workers who are international students, domestic students, paid to the different paycodes, total salary for all workers.
