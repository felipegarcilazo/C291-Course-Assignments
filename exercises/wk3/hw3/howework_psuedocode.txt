	Economy Class is A6-A12, B6-B12, C6-C12, D6-D12, E6-E12, F6-F12.
	A 0 in any element indicates it is empty and a 1 to show that it is taken.
Ask user for name as this will be saved.

	If user enters F then they will have a seat in First Class
	Else if user enters B then they will have a seat in business class
